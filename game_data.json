You drift above the ocean for miles, until you awaken on the shores of an abandoned island, your only possession, a questionably large power bank that comes with a reliable cable as its charger. The terrain is filled with puzzles and hazards. Navigate the island until a towering lighthouse emerges. If you can power it up and send its beam towards the sea, you might catch the attention of a passing ship… and earn your way home.\n\n-Info-\nThis experience was created for the Inspire 2025 Challenge. In order to appeal to multiple DevRel communities, we added a ingame book UI with translations that explain all of the features of our power bank. Because of the diversity of our team, we managed to get translations into English, German, Romanian, French, and Spanish. All of our keybinds are also conveniently listed on the bottom left of your screen, their uses are in the Book Ui.",

In this interactive experience, you're tasked with \"breaking\" the system of an old computer by exploring its files, using commands, and uncovering hidden secrets. With a variety of commands at your disposal, you can cause crashes, and even \"download\" mysterious files that could lead to system failures. Will you find all the ways to bring the system to its knees, or will you leave it intact?\n\n\nNote from the Developer:\n\nThis game was created in less than 2 days as part of my first game jam, and I did everything solo. Expect some bugs, as I had to work within a very tight timeframe. I had a lot of ideas for additional endings, but due to time constraints, I couldn't implement them all. Despite that, I really enjoyed the process and hope you have fun exploring the different ways to break the system!",

While we aren’t necessarily opposed to them, we like to play a little game here… We’ll offer you the ability to temporarily return to your feeble existence and in exchange you get to protect your family for as long as you can.\n\nDuring the day time we are unable to bring you back… However, you can collect clocks that contain the fabric of time itself using that nifty scythe we so kindly offered you. Up to 50 time units can be collected with this. When night falls, you will be able to be sent back and use the same scythe to send those sprits to the stratosphere.\n\nThere’s just one catch however… That scythe is the only thing keeping you in the real world, and it runs out of energy with each second that passes. Using the scythe will also take away.\n\nWe’ll see you back here when you eventually fail to protect the ones you love. Good luck!",

If we had one more hour, we could get rid of bugs. If you would like to see how the whole game should look like without bugs please visit place:\n\nhttps://www.roblox.com/games/18942624810\n\nChanges from the original are just a few very small fixes, to be exact it was 10 lines of code added and 12 removed. If we had started with other participants, this would be the final version (or better!!)\n\nYou can even see that we started a day later in the creation date. \n\nFor JURY - please consider everything written above and enjoy the gameplay :D\nPlease check both versions so you see whole map and enjoy full gameplay!\n\nProgramming | pazdanmichal2\nLevel design and Environment art | hEcros_415",

These divisions are used to achieve certain goals.\n\n-How to play-\nKey-binds listed in experience\n\n-Inspiration-\nOur submission is inspired by 2 player obstacle courses. Our single player game takes ideas from regular 2 player games but instead of the use of other players, you are able to divide your character into separate sections.\n\n\n\n\n",
