These changes must be made AND published by April 12th at 11:59 PM PST. <br /><br />After another week of review by our panel of judges, the top three experiences will be announced!

Up to 50 time units can be collected with this. When night falls, you will be able to be sent back and use the same scythe to send those sprits to the stratosphere.\n\nThere’s just one catch however… That scythe is the only thing keeping you in the real world, and it runs out of energy with each second that passes. Using the scythe will also take away.\n\nWe’ll see you back here when you eventually fail to protect the ones you love. Good luck!",

In a last-ditch effort, you use an experimental backpack that lets you travel back in time, but only for a short period. Your mission is to go back in time and prevent the events that lead to the apocalypse. To do this, you must journey into the past. The backpack's power is limited, so you'll need to recharge it by finding energy sources scattered throughout the past. If you run out of power, time will start reversing, sending you back to the present and erasing all your progress. Every mistake brings the apocalypse closer. Can you beat the clock, change the past, and save the world? Or will time become your enemy?\n\n(and yes, we made an original soundtrack for game jam lol)\n\nMade for Inspire 2024",

Those are small bugs, but it makes you unable to finish the game. Unfortunately we found Inspire event too late and started our work on it one day after it has started. If we had one more hour, we could get rid of bugs. If you would like to see how the whole game should look like without bugs please visit place:\n\nhttps://www.roblox.com/games/18942624810\n\nChanges from the original are just a few very small fixes, to be exact it was 10 lines of code added and 12 removed. If we had started with other participants, this would be the final version (or better!!)\n\nYou can even see that we started a day later in the creation date. \n\nFor JURY - please consider everything written above and enjoy the gameplay :D\nPlease check both versions so you see whole map and enjoy full gameplay!\n\nProgramming | pazdanmichal2\nLevel design and Environment art | hEcros_415",

Our take on this theme allows a regular character to divide in half as well as into quarters. These divisions are used to achieve certain goals.\n\n-How to play-\nKey-binds listed in experience\n\n-Inspiration-\nOur submission is inspired by 2 player obstacle courses. Our single player game takes ideas from regular 2 player games but instead of the use of other players, you are able to divide your character into separate sections.\n\n\n\n\n",
