You drift above the ocean for miles, until you awaken on the shores of an abandoned island, your only possession, a questionably large power bank that comes with a reliable cable as its charger. The terrain is filled with puzzles and hazards. Navigate the island until a towering lighthouse emerges. If you can power it up and send its beam towards the sea, you might catch the attention of a passing ship… and earn your way home.\n\n-Info-\nThis experience was created for the Inspire 2025 Challenge. In order to appeal to multiple DevRel communities, we added a ingame book UI with translations that explain all of the features of our power bank. Because of the diversity of our team, we managed to get translations into English, German, Romanian, French, and Spanish. All of our keybinds are also conveniently listed on the bottom left of your screen, their uses are in the Book Ui.",

His father, to ease his son's mind, suggests an activity. What if he created his own world and killed off any disease living within? In an adventure inspired by the boy's favorite video game, he finds peace in visualizing his mental strength as a ninja from his most enjoyed game. Does such character have the strength to defeat his fatal and imminent opponent?\n\nMade in 24h and less. So many features couldn't have been produced in time unfortunately. \n\nRDC 2024",

Those are small bugs, but it makes you unable to finish the game. Unfortunately we found Inspire event too late and started our work on it one day after it has started. If we had one more hour, we could get rid of bugs. If you would like to see how the whole game should look like without bugs please visit place:\n\nhttps://www.roblox.com/games/18942624810\n\nChanges from the original are just a few very small fixes, to be exact it was 10 lines of code added and 12 removed. If we had started with other participants, this would be the final version (or better!!)\n\nYou can even see that we started a day later in the creation date. \n\nFor JURY - please consider everything written above and enjoy the gameplay :D\nPlease check both versions so you see whole map and enjoy full gameplay!\n\nProgramming | pazdanmichal2\nLevel design and Environment art | hEcros_415",

To use some strong cards you will have to sacrifice others. One side is the defender while the other is the attacker, which switches at the end of every turn. After the attacker puts down their card and presses the bell, it’s the other player’s turn. \r\n\r\nYou win by filling your own bar.\r\n\r\nNote: Only flying cards can hit flying cards.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n    Scripters: ArawnVinheim, AraxiaVinheim\r\n    Builders/Modelers: MaestroVinheim, blendedrival\r\n    UI Designer: furuyaa\r\n",

We also had some issues causing us to make the whole second half of the game in 1 day so please excuse us if there are any bugs. If we make it to the semi-Finals I am sure to improve the mechanics and maps. \r\n\r\n\r\nControls: Press Q or E to switch between colors.
