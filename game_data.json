These changes must be made AND published by April 12th at 11:59 PM PST. <br /><br />After another week of review by our panel of judges, the top three experiences will be announced!

You are a dummy rig, spawned in for testing. When prompted with a choice, what will you do? Will you disrupt the brilliant work of the British narrator, or will you follow along? The choice is yours.\n\n(Due to bug I recommend rejoining if you are going for multiple endings in one play session!)\n(Sorry if you run into any bugs, the game was made in 3 days.

While we aren’t necessarily opposed to them, we like to play a little game here… We’ll offer you the ability to temporarily return to your feeble existence and in exchange you get to protect your family for as long as you can.\n\nDuring the day time we are unable to bring you back… However, you can collect clocks that contain the fabric of time itself using that nifty scythe we so kindly offered you. Up to 50 time units can be collected with this. When night falls, you will be able to be sent back and use the same scythe to send those sprits to the stratosphere.\n\nThere’s just one catch however… That scythe is the only thing keeping you in the real world, and it runs out of energy with each second that passes. Using the scythe will also take away.\n\nWe’ll see you back here when you eventually fail to protect the ones you love. Good luck!",

Parrying restores some timer so you can keep the fight going.\n\nThere are four phases, each one introducing a new mechanic:\n1: Simple hand attacks\n2: Spinning clock face on the stage\n3: Falling objects\n4: Max timer of 1:00\n\nBeating the game awards you with a badge for your efforts! Good luck everyone.\n\nCREDITS:\nScripting: Piptendo, Spoofify\nModeling, Animating, UI Assets: tommytherock\nMusic, Sound Assets: phr3tt",

        "description": "You are a scientist who is attempting to stop a nuclear apocalypse from happening. In a last-ditch effort, you use an experimental backpack that lets you travel back in time, but only for a short period. Your mission is to go back in time and prevent the events that lead to the apocalypse. To do this, you must journey into the past. The backpack's power is limited, so you'll need to recharge it by finding energy sources scattered throughout the past. If you run out of power, time will start reversing, sending you back to the present and erasing all your progress. Every mistake brings the apocalypse closer. Can you beat the clock, change the past, and save the world? Or will time become your enemy?\n\n(and yes, we made an original soundtrack for game jam lol)\n\nMade for Inspire 2024",
