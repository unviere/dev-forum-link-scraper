You drift above the ocean for miles, until you awaken on the shores of an abandoned island, your only possession, a questionably large power bank that comes with a reliable cable as its charger. The terrain is filled with puzzles and hazards. Navigate the island until a towering lighthouse emerges. If you can power it up and send its beam towards the sea, you might catch the attention of a passing ship‚Ä¶ and earn your way home.\n\n-Info-\nThis experience was created for the Inspire 2025 Challenge. In order to appeal to multiple DevRel communities, we added a ingame book UI with translations that explain all of the features of our power bank. Because of the diversity of our team, we managed to get translations into English, German, Romanian, French, and Spanish. All of our keybinds are also conveniently listed on the bottom left of your screen, their uses are in the Book Ui.",

In this interactive experience, you're tasked with \"breaking\" the system of an old computer by exploring its files, using commands, and uncovering hidden secrets. With a variety of commands at your disposal, you can cause crashes, and even \"download\" mysterious files that could lead to system failures. Will you find all the ways to bring the system to its knees, or will you leave it intact?\n\n\nNote from the Developer:\n\nThis game was created in less than 2 days as part of my first game jam, and I did everything solo. Expect some bugs, as I had to work within a very tight timeframe. I had a lot of ideas for additional endings, but due to time constraints, I couldn't implement them all. Despite that, I really enjoyed the process and hope you have fun exploring the different ways to break the system!",

Up to 50 time units can be collected with this. When night falls, you will be able to be sent back and use the same scythe to send those sprits to the stratosphere.\n\nThere‚Äôs just one catch however‚Ä¶ That scythe is the only thing keeping you in the real world, and it runs out of energy with each second that passes.

If we had one more hour, we could get rid of bugs. If you would like to see how the whole game should look like without bugs please visit place:\n\nhttps://www.roblox.com/games/18942624810\n\nChanges from the original are just a few very small fixes, to be exact it was 10 lines of code added and 12 removed. If we had started with other participants, this would be the final version (or better!!)\n\nYou can even see that we started a day later in the creation date. \n\nFor JURY - please consider everything written above and enjoy the gameplay :D\nPlease check both versions so you see whole map and enjoy full gameplay!\n\nProgramming | pazdanmichal2\nLevel design and Environment art | hEcros_415",

This game was made for a game jam, with only 48 hours to create it all. \n\nSome potential bugs;\n\n-When opening/touching doors, walk back a few steps and then Proceed with the dialogue. Sometimes our doors are finnicky.\n -> If that didn't work for the door opening, try walking into in and backing up a few times. \n-Sometimes the dialogue is buggy. Give it some time!\n-If the GRAY door doesn't open, run into it with shift lock on and it will eventually work.\n\nThank you for playing!",

These divisions are used to achieve certain goals.\n\n-How to play-\nKey-binds listed in experience\n\n-Inspiration-\nOur submission is inspired by 2 player obstacle courses.

        "description": "Snapshot is my submission for the Roblox Connect Challenge of 2023. Its an artistic experience which allows you to create parallel versions of your characters state & position, and save them in-game forever. The Snapshots, like parallel universes, can tell various stories, evoke different emotions, and represent a rich tapestry of creativity. Each pose represents a parallel moment, a state in which your character was once in, which will be forever preserved in time. Future plans: Building system. Build anything you can imagine on an infinite map, which will save & be loaded each new server. \n\n*NOTE TO CHALLENGE STAFF*\nI forget if I listed the animation gui as premade in the form (complete oversight), but if not I am sorry and yes its also premade.",
