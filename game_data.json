You drift above the ocean for miles, until you awaken on the shores of an abandoned island, your only possession, a questionably large power bank that comes with a reliable cable as its charger. The terrain is filled with puzzles and hazards. Navigate the island until a towering lighthouse emerges. If you can power it up and send its beam towards the sea, you might catch the attention of a passing ship‚Ä¶ and earn your way home.\n\n-Info-\nThis experience was created for the Inspire 2025 Challenge. In order to appeal to multiple DevRel communities, we added a ingame book UI with translations that explain all of the features of our power bank. Because of the diversity of our team, we managed to get translations into English, German, Romanian, French, and Spanish. All of our keybinds are also conveniently listed on the bottom left of your screen, their uses are in the Book Ui.",

In this interactive experience, you're tasked with \"breaking\" the system of an old computer by exploring its files, using commands, and uncovering hidden secrets. With a variety of commands at your disposal, you can cause crashes, and even \"download\" mysterious files that could lead to system failures. Will you find all the ways to bring the system to its knees, or will you leave it intact?\n\n\nNote from the Developer:\n\nThis game was created in less than 2 days as part of my first game jam, and I did everything solo. Expect some bugs, as I had to work within a very tight timeframe. I had a lot of ideas for additional endings, but due to time constraints, I couldn't implement them all. Despite that, I really enjoyed the process and hope you have fun exploring the different ways to break the system!",

As you wake up, you realise you are trapped in some sort of void dimension, where everything but you is black and white. As you explore, you notice you have the strange power of bending time itself in the wormhole, as well as the fact that time seems to move much slower, as just a few seconds in the wormhole can be equal to years in the real world.\n\nYou feel the winds of endless white whirl around you.\n\nYou notice the silhouette of what seems to be a human, having three pairs of wings and it's heart exposed.",

In a last-ditch effort, you use an experimental backpack that lets you travel back in time, but only for a short period. Your mission is to go back in time and prevent the events that lead to the apocalypse. To do this, you must journey into the past. The backpack's power is limited, so you'll need to recharge it by finding energy sources scattered throughout the past. If you run out of power, time will start reversing, sending you back to the present and erasing all your progress. Every mistake brings the apocalypse closer. Can you beat the clock, change the past, and save the world? Or will time become your enemy?\n\n(and yes, we made an original soundtrack for game jam lol)\n\nMade for Inspire 2024",

If we had one more hour, we could get rid of bugs. If you would like to see how the whole game should look like without bugs please visit place:\n\nhttps://www.roblox.com/games/18942624810\n\nChanges from the original are just a few very small fixes, to be exact it was 10 lines of code added and 12 removed. If we had started with other participants, this would be the final version (or better!!)\n\nYou can even see that we started a day later in the creation date. \n\nFor JURY - please consider everything written above and enjoy the gameplay :D\nPlease check both versions so you see whole map and enjoy full gameplay!\n\nProgramming | pazdanmichal2\nLevel design and Environment art | hEcros_415",

Each pose represents a parallel moment, a state in which your character was once in, which will be forever preserved in time. Future plans: Building system. Build anything you can imagine on an infinite map, which will save & be loaded each new server. \n\n*NOTE TO CHALLENGE STAFF*\nI forget if I listed the animation gui as premade in the form (complete oversight), but if not I am sorry and yes its also premade.",

To use some strong cards you will have to sacrifice others. One side is the defender while the other is the attacker, which switches at the end of every turn. After the attacker puts down their card and presses the bell, it‚Äôs the other player‚Äôs turn. \r\n\r\nYou win by filling your own bar.\r\n\r\nNote: Only flying cards can hit flying cards.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n    Scripters: ArawnVinheim, AraxiaVinheim\r\n    Builders/Modelers: MaestroVinheim, blendedrival\r\n    UI Designer: furuyaa\r\n",
