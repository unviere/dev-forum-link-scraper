These changes must be made AND published by April 12th at 11:59 PM PST. <br /><br />After another week of review by our panel of judges, the top three experiences will be announced!

        "description": "Broken Nurture (First Contact) This game is a first-person psychological horror experience set inside a familiar home that slowly becomes oppressive over several days. Each morning begins with a phone call from the father, whose voice grows colder and more controlling, establishing a sense of constant surveillance and emotional pressure. During the day, the player performs household duties that maintain the appearance of order, while at night sleep leads to disturbing dream sequences where a long, narrowing hallway symbolizes mounting psychological stress. The game avoids jump scares and instead builds tension through atmosphere, repetition, and emotional discomfort rooted in everyday family dynamics. The experience culminates in a final confrontation with the truth behind the household and the control that defines it.\n\nWe come from Vietnam\n\nDev: @athea56789 @Rabbit_revenge @nhattung599 @Sakura_ChanTYT\n\nRoblox Developer Challenge 2026\n#DevChallenge2026\nThanks for playing!\n\n",

The planet was quiet, unclaimed, and absolutely full of useful stuff — a rare cosmic coincidence.\nAs an officially unofficial space mining operation, your job is simple: set up drills, move resources, expand storage, and gently borrow everything that isn’t bolted down. This is not exploitation. It’s efficient cooperation.\nThe locals are rocks. The climate is stable enough. Earth comparisons are unnecessary.\n\nGood luck. This is for the good of humanity…\ndespite Earth’s earlier results.\n\nFeatures:\n- Randomly generated alien terrains\n- Upgradeable mining buildings\n- Infinite layout combinations\n- Conveyor logic for efficient chaos\n- Your very own robotic companion (morally optional)\n\nMade by: \n Nova_MrRoyal (Code)\n Keeenchi (Code)\n EinMarek (Code)\n Stayroh (Code)\n Leon_Kokosnuss (Build)\n",

You drift above the ocean for miles, until you awaken on the shores of an abandoned island, your only possession, a questionably large power bank that comes with a reliable cable as its charger. The terrain is filled with puzzles and hazards. Navigate the island until a towering lighthouse emerges. If you can power it up and send its beam towards the sea, you might catch the attention of a passing ship… and earn your way home.\n\n-Info-\nThis experience was created for the Inspire 2025 Challenge. In order to appeal to multiple DevRel communities, we added a ingame book UI with translations that explain all of the features of our power bank. Because of the diversity of our team, we managed to get translations into English, German, Romanian, French, and Spanish. All of our keybinds are also conveniently listed on the bottom left of your screen, their uses are in the Book Ui.",

Up to 50 time units can be collected with this. When night falls, you will be able to be sent back and use the same scythe to send those sprits to the stratosphere.\n\nThere’s just one catch however… That scythe is the only thing keeping you in the real world, and it runs out of energy with each second that passes. Using the scythe will also take away.\n\nWe’ll see you back here when you eventually fail to protect the ones you love. Good luck!",

In a last-ditch effort, you use an experimental backpack that lets you travel back in time, but only for a short period. Your mission is to go back in time and prevent the events that lead to the apocalypse. To do this, you must journey into the past. The backpack's power is limited, so you'll need to recharge it by finding energy sources scattered throughout the past. If you run out of power, time will start reversing, sending you back to the present and erasing all your progress. Every mistake brings the apocalypse closer. Can you beat the clock, change the past, and save the world? Or will time become your enemy?\n\n(and yes, we made an original soundtrack for game jam lol)\n\nMade for Inspire 2024",
