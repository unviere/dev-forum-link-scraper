        "description": "Broken Nurture (First Contact) This game is a first-person psychological horror experience set inside a familiar home that slowly becomes oppressive over several days. Each morning begins with a phone call from the father, whose voice grows colder and more controlling, establishing a sense of constant surveillance and emotional pressure. During the day, the player performs household duties that maintain the appearance of order, while at night sleep leads to disturbing dream sequences where a long, narrowing hallway symbolizes mounting psychological stress. The game avoids jump scares and instead builds tension through atmosphere, repetition, and emotional discomfort rooted in everyday family dynamics. The experience culminates in a final confrontation with the truth behind the household and the control that defines it.\n\nWe come from Vietnam\n\nDev: @athea56789 @Rabbit_revenge @nhattung599 @Sakura_ChanTYT\n\nRoblox Developer Challenge 2026\n#DevChallenge2026\nThanks for playing!\n\n",

You drift above the ocean for miles, until you awaken on the shores of an abandoned island, your only possession, a questionably large power bank that comes with a reliable cable as its charger. The terrain is filled with puzzles and hazards. Navigate the island until a towering lighthouse emerges. If you can power it up and send its beam towards the sea, you might catch the attention of a passing ship… and earn your way home.\n\n-Info-\nThis experience was created for the Inspire 2025 Challenge. In order to appeal to multiple DevRel communities, we added a ingame book UI with translations that explain all of the features of our power bank. Because of the diversity of our team, we managed to get translations into English, German, Romanian, French, and Spanish. All of our keybinds are also conveniently listed on the bottom left of your screen, their uses are in the Book Ui.",

In this interactive experience, you're tasked with \"breaking\" the system of an old computer by exploring its files, using commands, and uncovering hidden secrets. With a variety of commands at your disposal, you can cause crashes, and even \"download\" mysterious files that could lead to system failures. Will you find all the ways to bring the system to its knees, or will you leave it intact?\n\n\nNote from the Developer:\n\nThis game was created in less than 2 days as part of my first game jam, and I did everything solo. Expect some bugs, as I had to work within a very tight timeframe. I had a lot of ideas for additional endings, but due to time constraints, I couldn't implement them all. Despite that, I really enjoyed the process and hope you have fun exploring the different ways to break the system!",

Since the plaza hasn't been touched in ages, there might be entities lurking beneath the surface that will attack you on sight! Failing a machine is not recommended either!🧟‍♀️\n\n🌠Choose between 6 different types of characters to play as, each with their own unique stats!🌠\n\n🔽How deep can you go?

        "description": "You are a scientist who is attempting to stop a nuclear apocalypse from happening. In a last-ditch effort, you use an experimental backpack that lets you travel back in time, but only for a short period. Your mission is to go back in time and prevent the events that lead to the apocalypse. To do this, you must journey into the past. The backpack's power is limited, so you'll need to recharge it by finding energy sources scattered throughout the past. If you run out of power, time will start reversing, sending you back to the present and erasing all your progress. Every mistake brings the apocalypse closer. Can you beat the clock, change the past, and save the world? Or will time become your enemy?\n\n(and yes, we made an original soundtrack for game jam lol)\n\nMade for Inspire 2024",

These divisions are used to achieve certain goals.\n\n-How to play-\nKey-binds listed in experience\n\n-Inspiration-\nOur submission is inspired by 2 player obstacle courses.
