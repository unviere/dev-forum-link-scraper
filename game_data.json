        "description": "Decades ago, your brother sent you a letter. You were not ready to open it then. But as you go through it now... should you have read it all those years ago?\n\nThis game is my submission for the 2025 Inspire Challenge. I am a solo dev, sorry in advance if the game is a tad laggy.\n\nIt was made on a road trip, in a laundromat, and I occasionally used gas station wifi. It has been a crazy three days, but I wanted to participate in this challenge, and I appreciate the support.",

In this interactive experience, you're tasked with \"breaking\" the system of an old computer by exploring its files, using commands, and uncovering hidden secrets. With a variety of commands at your disposal, you can cause crashes, and even \"download\" mysterious files that could lead to system failures. Will you find all the ways to bring the system to its knees, or will you leave it intact?\n\n\nNote from the Developer:\n\nThis game was created in less than 2 days as part of my first game jam, and I did everything solo. Expect some bugs, as I had to work within a very tight timeframe. I had a lot of ideas for additional endings, but due to time constraints, I couldn't implement them all. Despite that, I really enjoyed the process and hope you have fun exploring the different ways to break the system!",

What will its fate be? 🤔\n\nThe game's art style is inspired by the classic look of old Roblox. But we've added colourful, cartoon textures that bring a more modern and playful vibe to the whole experience. We've even crafted an original soundtrack that perfectly matches the theme of our game, making your adventure even more enjoyable! 🎶\n\n🌟Play now and find out what happens in Robloxia! 🌟\n\n🖥️ ONLY PLAYABLE ON DESKTOP/LAPTOP! 🖥️",

Up to 50 time units can be collected with this. When night falls, you will be able to be sent back and use the same scythe to send those sprits to the stratosphere.\n\nThere’s just one catch however… That scythe is the only thing keeping you in the real world, and it runs out of energy with each second that passes. Using the scythe will also take away.\n\nWe’ll see you back here when you eventually fail to protect the ones you love. Good luck!",

In a last-ditch effort, you use an experimental backpack that lets you travel back in time, but only for a short period. Your mission is to go back in time and prevent the events that lead to the apocalypse. To do this, you must journey into the past. The backpack's power is limited, so you'll need to recharge it by finding energy sources scattered throughout the past. If you run out of power, time will start reversing, sending you back to the present and erasing all your progress. Every mistake brings the apocalypse closer. Can you beat the clock, change the past, and save the world? Or will time become your enemy?\n\n(and yes, we made an original soundtrack for game jam lol)\n\nMade for Inspire 2024",

Those are small bugs, but it makes you unable to finish the game. Unfortunately we found Inspire event too late and started our work on it one day after it has started. If we had one more hour, we could get rid of bugs. If you would like to see how the whole game should look like without bugs please visit place:\n\nhttps://www.roblox.com/games/18942624810\n\nChanges from the original are just a few very small fixes, to be exact it was 10 lines of code added and 12 removed. If we had started with other participants, this would be the final version (or better!!)\n\nYou can even see that we started a day later in the creation date. \n\nFor JURY - please consider everything written above and enjoy the gameplay :D\nPlease check both versions so you see whole map and enjoy full gameplay!\n\nProgramming | pazdanmichal2\nLevel design and Environment art | hEcros_415",

Our take on this theme allows a regular character to divide in half as well as into quarters. These divisions are used to achieve certain goals.\n\n-How to play-\nKey-binds listed in experience\n\n-Inspiration-\nOur submission is inspired by 2 player obstacle courses. Our single player game takes ideas from regular 2 player games but instead of the use of other players, you are able to divide your character into separate sections.\n\n\n\n\n",
