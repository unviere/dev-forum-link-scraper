You drift above the ocean for miles, until you awaken on the shores of an abandoned island, your only possession, a questionably large power bank that comes with a reliable cable as its charger. The terrain is filled with puzzles and hazards. Navigate the island until a towering lighthouse emerges. If you can power it up and send its beam towards the sea, you might catch the attention of a passing ship… and earn your way home.\n\n-Info-\nThis experience was created for the Inspire 2025 Challenge. In order to appeal to multiple DevRel communities, we added a ingame book UI with translations that explain all of the features of our power bank. Because of the diversity of our team, we managed to get translations into English, German, Romanian, French, and Spanish. All of our keybinds are also conveniently listed on the bottom left of your screen, their uses are in the Book Ui.",

        "description": "You are a scientist who is attempting to stop a nuclear apocalypse from happening. In a last-ditch effort, you use an experimental backpack that lets you travel back in time, but only for a short period. Your mission is to go back in time and prevent the events that lead to the apocalypse. To do this, you must journey into the past. The backpack's power is limited, so you'll need to recharge it by finding energy sources scattered throughout the past. If you run out of power, time will start reversing, sending you back to the present and erasing all your progress. Every mistake brings the apocalypse closer. Can you beat the clock, change the past, and save the world? Or will time become your enemy?\n\n(and yes, we made an original soundtrack for game jam lol)\n\nMade for Inspire 2024",
